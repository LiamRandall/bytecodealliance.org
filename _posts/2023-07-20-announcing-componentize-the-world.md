## Agenda

At this event, participants will have the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of the WebAssembly Component model. Attendees will be porting popular language frameworks from Rust, JavaScript, and potentially other languages into WebAssembly components with the help and guidance of the teams building the core open source tooling.  Participants will collaborate in guided sessions to help validate and build popular frameworks as components and participate in all aspects of the development lifecycle including implementation, qa, testing, and more.

This Hackathon will also include a 'Documentathon'. Participants are encouraged to contribute to our comprehensive library of documentation, assist with effective messaging, and create engaging blog posts. This activity is designed to recognize the importance of each role within the product development ecosystem and provide a platform for those roles to be exercised, recognized, and prioritized.

The Bytecode Alliance extends this invitation to developers, product managers, and all professionals involved in the product development ecosystem. We foster a diverse and inclusive environment, and we welcome the participation of all interested parties.  While we maintain a professional atmosphere, the Bytecode Alliance also promotes a light-hearted and engaging environment that encourages collaboration, knowledge sharing, and creativity.
